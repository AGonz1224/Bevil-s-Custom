      <h1>About Caleb Bevil</h1>

      <div class="bio-container">
        <p>Caleb Bevil's journey is rooted in a rich family legacy of craftsmanship and hard work. Growing up with a grandfather who was a skilled gunsmith, Caleb was exposed to metalworking and hands-on craftsmanship from an early age. His grandfather's influence sparked a passion for metalwork that Caleb has nurtured since the age of 13, primarily through self-teaching and hands-on experience.</p>
        <p>Caleb's career path has been as diverse as his skill set. He has spent time working on oil rigs as a derrick rigger, where he honed his expertise in heavy-duty equipment and safety procedures. His work in this demanding environment has given him a deep understanding of the importance of precision, dedication, and teamwork.</p>
        <p>Outside of his professional achievements, Caleb is a proud father and husband. He is supported by an amazing son and wife, who continue to inspire and motivate him every day. Caleb's commitment to his craft, his family, and his continuous growth as both a professional and an individual defines the foundation of his life.</p>
