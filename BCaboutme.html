      <h1>About Caleb Bevil</h1>

      <div class="bio-container">
        <p>
          Caleb Bevil's journey is rooted in a rich family legacy of craftsmanship and hard work.
          Growing up with a grandfather who was a skilled gunsmith, Caleb was exposed to metalworking
          and hands-on craftsmanship from an early age. His grandfather's influence sparked a passion
          for metalwork that Caleb has nurtured since the age of 13, primarily through self-teaching
          and hands-on experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Caleb's career path has been as diverse as his skill set. He has spent time working on oil
          rigs as a derrick rigger, where he honed his expertise in heavy-duty equipment and safety
          procedures. His work in this demanding environment has given him a deep understanding of the
          importance of precision, dedication, and teamwork.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of his professional achievements, Caleb is a proud father and husband. He is supported
          by an amazing son and wife, who continue to inspire and motivate him every day. Caleb's
          commitment to his craft, his family, and his continuous growth as both a professional and an
          individual defines the foundation of his life.
