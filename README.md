# Bevil's Custom

**First Code Project** — a digital flyer-style website built for a local fabrication business.

## 🔨 About the Project

This website was designed to give Bevil's Custom a strong digital presence. 
It serves as a simple, responsive landing page that highlights services, pricing, and contact options.

The business owner is a friend of mine, and this project is helping us both: 
I get hands-on experience designing and coding a real-world website, and he gets 
a web presence for his shop. The project is still in progress — it currently 
includes code submitted for a school assignment while I wait for feedback from the 
owner on additional features he’d like to include.
