# Bevil's Custom

**First Code Project** — a digital flyer-style website built for a local fabrication business.  

## 🔨 About the Project

This project was created to give **Bevil's Custom** a strong digital presence.  
It’s a simple, responsive landing page that highlights services, contact options, and company branding.  

The business owner is a friend of mine, so this project has been mutually beneficial:  
I gain real-world web development experience, and he gets a modern online presence for his shop.  

The site started as a school assignment but has grown into a **real client project**. It now reflects client feedback and evolving branding needs.
